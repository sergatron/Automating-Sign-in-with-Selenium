# Automating the Sign-in Process using Selenium

This script uses Selenium to navigate to the NY's EZPass url and through the website to download a statement given specific dates. Sign-in credentials are prompted when executing the script. Username and password are not stored in any files but must be typed in at the command line along with dates. Given the credentials and dates, the script will navigate through the site and download a PDF version of the statement and then exit the browser.
